For this project, I chose 5 different stocks from each of 5 industries: technology, consumer goods, healthcare, services, and financial. I chose many of the stocks that I was interested in, had data since the beginning of 2008, and chose stocks that did not pay out regular dividends. I used the stockPortfolio package to perform my analysis on the stocks. After digital retrieval of their data, I analysed their historical data, which consisted of their monthly return between 2008 and 2013. Using that historical data, I found the optimal portfolio by various methods: the Markowitz model, single index model, constant correlation model, and multi group model. I also compared the optimal portfolios for the aforementioned models both when short selling is allowed and disallowed.
